# age_calculator.py
Code for create an age calculator by using different time parameter or units

# Journey during the creating project
  as per question, i want to evaluate the age of user in different time parameter or units provided by the users
that means i want to show two inputs, first input- i want to get user age and 
second input-I want time parameter from that user to show his age in that particular parameter
for getting age in different parameters, we will have to perform mathematical calculation of different time parameter
Steps1- We defined the code (we will also use this code by function name means we didn't need to create this code 
again and again. for use this code we only entered the defined function name) 
Steps-2create some arithmetical operations for creating logics
for eg: if we want age in month then we have using arithmetical operations (multiplication) for getting age.
		Month = year x 12
we did same procedure for days, hours, minute, seconds
steps3-after mathematical calculation, i did prints the all objects
then i got the outputs of all time parameters
but i want to print only age in particular time parameter 
steps4-therefore i needed user input for particular time parameter as choose any time parameter
for time parameter i did print the various time parameter with key value pair for understanding the user for what kind of 
time parameter should we select
for it create a dictionary with shortform and full form, if user type m then python check the dictionary and pickup 
the "m" value then finding the values in performed code.

then we call the function for execute

For output we are providing the age in years
then we see the Various option of time parameter for choose
then we choose the any one option for getting result 
the we got the result in, we choosed option

By using this code we easily calculate the our age in different time parameter like months, days, hours, 
minutes and seconds after put the age in years

# Dificulties during project
when i start the project that time i am easily def the function and also perform the all arithmeticals function but when i want to perform program for single unit output then that time i am stuck for long time but after passing time i am successfull to perform for single unit. but when i start to write a code that many things related project taking movement in my mind in there one is "duration of person lived in____" and 2 is "time parameter statement" for understanding the user what they want to type for getting result.
